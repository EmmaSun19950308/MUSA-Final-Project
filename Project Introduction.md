# Project Introduction:

Belgium has a decent public transport network, offering accessible and efficient travel across the country. Although geographically small, Belgium is bursting with popular cities like Brussels,Liege,Charleroi, Gent, and Antwerpen, connected by the vast network of the train system, connected by the vast network of the train system. Thanks to the dense railway network, taking trains has become the most efficient way to commute and travel among towns and cities. 

However, with the increasing demand of taking trains as well as the unbalanced development across the country, some train lines can be extremely busy with a high occupancy level, while other lines might be under operated. City planners and train conductors are super interested in the tool which can help them analyze and estimate the train occupancy level, so that they can develop a better understanding of optimizing railway operation across the country. 

Existing projects and applications have made efforts to address pertinent problems but more from the perspective of customers. They have leveraged the pre-existing data and real-time data to help passengers direct a route. This project as well as the synchronous App, nevertheless, targets transportation planners including city planners and train conductors, and is dedicated to smarter decisions and better service. To facilitate the effort, this project employs regression models with comprehensive features to predict occupancy level of each train line, and embeds the algorithm into the developing App to help monitor and analyze the occupancy issue. 

Specifically, this project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict high/low occupancy rate of trains in Belgium on the station's basis by integrating various data sources. Model is validated across 100 folders and space patterns. The project offers insights on resource allocation, route optimization for city planners and train conductors.
